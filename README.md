[Vipps](https://vipps.no) is a Norwegian payment service, used by more than 3 million people. 
Vipps was originally developed by DNB, but is now a separate company, which includes BankID and BankAxept. Vipps developer resources are available on GitHub: https://github.com/vippsas

## Prerequisites

Authorization is token-based and you can generate tokens yourself using Merchant Integration Environment. 
Please [contact Vipps integration] in order to access [Vipps Developer Portal].

## Quick start

Add Vipps SDK to your project using [Composer].

```bash
$ composer require mvd/vipps:^2.0
```

Vipps SDK uses [PSR-7] compliant http-message plugin system, hence before you require `mvd/vipps` you must 
add http client adapter of your choice, ex. `php-http/guzzle6-adapter` [(read more)](https://github.com/php-http/guzzle6-adapter).
